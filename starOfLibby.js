    story: `The sound of gunshots disrupted the peaceful forest song as Aoi and Nikono chased Libby and Red deep into the forest.</br></br>Libby: Red watch out!</br></br>Red goes behind a tree and barely dodges a bullet as it hits the side of the tree, Red is petrified, and he breathes heavily as he thinks his last breath will be taken away by a bullet.</br></br>Libby follows Red to the tree and crouches down and catches a breath.</br></br>Libby: I'm gonna go behind that tree and knock out that guy and you make a run for it okay?</br></br>Red looks at Libby with a dead expression but he trusts Libby and calms down a bit.</br></br>Red: O-okay.</br></br>Libby runs to another tree trying to not get spotted by Aoi and Nikono.</br></br>Nikono: They went behind that tree!</br></br>Aoi reloads his handgun while running to the tree red ran too.</br></br>Nikono shoots the tree but misses Red, Libby appears behind him, Nikono rapidly turns around but falls and faints as Libby delivers a powerful punch.</br></br>Aoi sees Libby and starts shooting at him but misses as Libby rapidly runs to another tree.</br></br>Aoi: Shit!</br></br>Two policemen come running down the forest, Aoi hears the men coming and retreats while carrying Nikono.</br></br>Aoi: Hey Get up, Get up!</br></br>Aoi runs as fast as he can going deeper into the forest so he wasn't seen anymore.</br></br>Libby: Red they're gone!</br></br>Red: Y-you Sure?</br></br>Policeman 1: Get Down!</br></br>The policeman grabs Libby's and Red's hands while pinning them down.</br></br>Policeman 1: Search them.</br></br>The policeman searches Libby's and Red's bodies for guns.</br></br>Policeman 2: Nothing.</br></br>Policeman 1: Search that bag.</br></br>Libby: Officer! Were innocent the ones with the guns ran that way.</br></br>Libby pointed north with his index finger. The policeman looked the way Libby pointed but he saw no one; he looked at Libby with a mad face.</br></br>Policeman 2: I found a Glock 23 with some bullets still in it.</br></br>Policeman 1: Get up!</br></br>Libby: Wait, wait that's not ours, it's not ours!</br></br>Policeman 1: Shut your mouth!!.</br></br>The policemen handcuff Libby and Red and then took them to their car and sat them down on the backseats of the vehicle</br></br>Libby: We're not guilty, we've been framed, you gotta believe us two people had the guns they were shooting at us in the first place.</br></br>Libby: Please officer, you gotta believe me!</br></br>The policeman, annoyed by Libby, grabs a roll of duct tape and rips a piece off, and places it on Libby's mouth.</br></br>Libby: Wait! … "Mumble" "Mumble"</br></br>Libby starts kicking the driver's seat as he tries to speak.</br></br>The policemen arrive at the police station where they will hold Libby and Red until a bus takes them to the prison.</br></br>The policeman locks Libby and Red in a small holding cell and the policeman gets close to Libby to take off the tape in his mouth.</br></br>Libby starts shaking his head but the policeman slaps Libby and grabs his head. He grabs an end of the tape and pulls hard on the tape.</br></br>Libby with a few tears in his eyes tries to hide the pain.</br></br>Policeman 1: Haha… Fucking child.</br></br>Libby: O-officer you got to believe me those guns are not ours!</br></br>Policeman 1: Shut it, you'll have your chance to speak in court, and both of you will be detained for 12 hours or less.</br></br>Libby: 12 hours!</br></br>Policeman 1: Yeah?</br></br>Libby: Ah thank you, officer!</br></br>Policeman 1: Okay, gimme your finger. I need to take some fingerprints.</br></br>The police officer grabbed Libby's and Red's fingers and put them on oil and then printed them on paper.</br></br>Policeman 1: Done, Stay seated here until I come back.</br></br>The police officer leaves the cell room.</br></br>Libby: Auh, Red this isn't good!</br></br>Red: I-i know that.</br></br>Libby: Red you're shaking like crazy.</br></br>Red: S-sorry.</br></br>Libby: Don't worry.</br></br>Red: I will try not to worry about the situation a bit too much.</br></br>Libby: Yeah they will soon realize we are innocent and have nothing to do with the gun.</br></br>Libby:<em> My day is ruined by this, I was going to get a good lunch today…</em></br></br>Libby feels nervous and mad at the same time, and Red feels scared and miserable.</br></br>Red:<em> If I never had looked into that cabin this would have not happened, Uwaaa!!</em></br></br>Libby looks at red and notices distress in his composure and the way his hand twitches.</br></br>1 hour has passed.</br></br>Policeman 1: Hey the judge will see you now.</br></br>Libby: Finally!</br></br>The policeman opens the cell door and lets Libby and Red out.</br></br>Policeman 1: Follow me.</br></br>Libby and Red follow the Policeman to the courtroom. Behind the doors was a small room with seats that were all set in rows while the judge was waiting at his desk.</br></br>Judge: Please take your seats.</br></br>Policeman 1: You stand here, you over there.</br></br>Judge: Libby Hart, is that your full name correct?</br></br>Libby: Yes, it is.</br></br>Judge: Okay, you are here today because you were found with an authorized weapon only available to law enforcement or the military.</br></br>Judge: You will not be charged with anything, you will be free after you answer some questions.</br></br>Judge: During discovery, we found several lost bullets that are not from the gun that was found in your bag, and from the fingerprints we took earlier, we found no fingerprints of you on the gun.</br></br>Policeman 1: We did find someone else's fingerprints though.</br></br>Judge: Right.</br></br>Judge: Libby, do you know where these fingerprints came from?</br></br>Libby: Yes, it might have been from that guy that dropped his gun and then placed it in my bag but I'm not too sure.</br></br>Judge: Was there only one person?</br></br>Libby: No, two people were chasing us.</br></br>Judge: Can you describe them?</br></br>Libby: Yes a little bit, one had blonde hair and a black leather jacket, and the other guy had a brown beanie, I can't remember any more information sorry.</br></br>Libby: Red did you see what they looked like?</br></br>Red: Y-yes, one had blonde hair and a black leather jacket with jeans and a scar on his left cheek, and the other guy had a brown beanie with a black shirt and some black sweatpants. He was all in black so I could not see any more of him.</br></br>Judge: Can you tell me how the gunfight started?</br></br>Libby: Red?</br></br>Red: Yes, u-um I was walking to my home when I stumbled upon a cabin with some light coming out the window I took a little peak and that's where I saw the guy with the beanie, what I saw inside was three guys doing crystal meth suddenly one of then turned around and saw me, that's where I ran away and the next day I was being chased by them.</br></br>Judge: I see, Libby was with you the whole time?</br></br>Red: yes he met after he left his job.</br></br>Judge: Okay, Thank you Libby Hart and Red Madden you may go now.</br></br>Libby: Thank you.</br></br>So the case was excused, and Libby and Red returned to their homes.</br></br>Red: I was scared the whole time but after I heard that we were innocent that gave me relief.</br></br>Libby: Yes, I was a bit scared too, but in the end they let us go.</br></br>Red: Yeah, I'm glad that's over.</br></br>Libby: Well see you tomorrow.</br></br>Red: yeah yeah, cya.</br></br>They depart, each other going to their homes.</br></br>Libby opens the door to his house where he finds his dad slouching on his sofa.</br></br>Libby: Hey dad, I went to jail today…</br></br>Wyatt: …</br></br>Libby: Of course, he isn't gonna respond, he's drunk! He doesn't care, all he cares about is his beer.</br></br>Libby opens the door to his room and walks in, he takes out some money from his pocket and puts it in his savings box. He notices there's no money in the box.</br></br>Libby: ?.</br></br>Libby: Hey, did you take my money?</br></br>Wyatt: I borrowed it.</br></br>Libby: What did you do to it? tell me.</br></br>Wyatt: I-i only paid the bills when the landlord came earlier.</br></br>Libby: I paid the bills last week…</br></br>Libby: You're lying!</br></br>Wyatt drinks a beer trying to ignore his son.</br></br>Libby runs to the fridge and sees two new packets of beer.</br></br>Libby: You, you spent it all on beer!</br></br>Libby looks at his dad, of course, he was very drunk as he could not move or speak clearly.</br></br>Libby: How many cans did you drink?</br></br>Wyatt: Uhhh, 2...</br></br>Libby goes to the trashcan and sees some cans on the ground and a lot on the trashcan.</br></br>Libby: That was to pay next week's rent, and you spent it all on beer. How irresponsible can you be!</br></br>Wyatt: Sh-shut up!</br></br>Libby: No you shut up, let me talk, do you know that we might go homeless because of your decision?</br></br>Libby: It's pointless, you were always like this, all you ever cared about is your beer, you never cared about us, me and mom, it's your fault mom died.</br></br>Wyatt: D-don't mention her, Libby!</br></br>Libby: Well it's true, I bet she hated every moment of your marriage!</br></br>Wyatt: Shut the hell up!</br></br>Libby: If it wasn't for your addiction maybe we would have had the money to buy the medicine for her illness!</br></br>Wyatt: Enough Libby!!</br></br>Wyatt throws a can at Libby as hard as he could but misses and instead it hits far into a wall.</br></br>Libby: I wish you never were my dad!</br></br>Wyatt: Get out!, NOW NOW.</br></br>Libby: Fine, I'll leave this place, you won't be hearing from me anymore!</br></br>Libby goes to his room and grabs his belongings, opens his closet and grabs all his clothes that are all the same, and leaves the apartment house while slamming the door.</br></br>Libby: I fucking hate him!</br></br>Libby leaves his only home, he was filled with rage that rage blinded him.</br></br>Wyatt: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</br></br>Wyatt falls to the ground and starts crying.</br></br>After a walk Libby relaxes a bit, it was night, the stars were bright and everyone was asleep, Libby sits down on a bench he found nearby and thinks.</br></br>Libby:<em> What am I gonna do now?</em></br></br>Libby: I just left my only home, I can't ask Red to let me stay at his place: His dad is gonna kick me out. I don't have a lot of money, so I can't get a hotel room... Welp, guess I gotta sleep here tonight.</br></br></br></br>Libby looks up.</br></br>Libby: Moving to the big city has to wait a while, sigh.</br></br>Libby lays down on the bench, closes his eyes, and goes to sleep.</br></br>The next day Libby wakes up as the sun shines on his face.</br></br>Libby stands up and grabs his belongings but notices he is missing his wallet.</br></br>Libby: Where is it? It has to be here.</br></br>Libby checks everywhere for his wallet but he can't find it.</br></br>Libby: Oh no.</br></br>Libby ignores the fact and rushes to his job where he works as a cashier for a clothing store.</br></br>Libby opens the door to the shop and looks at the time.</br></br>Libby:<em> I made it on time!</em></br></br>Libby: Hi boss.</br></br>Reu: Hello Libby, here's the list of orders and the numbers to their lockers.</br></br>Reu passes Libby a clipboard with the orders.</br></br>Libby: Okay I'll go to my counter.</br></br>Reu: Yeah.</br></br>A tall blonde guy walks inside the shop and looks around.</br></br>Aoi: I'm here to pick up an order.</br></br>Libby: Okay what number?</br></br>Aoi: 3.</br></br>Libby: Aoi?</br></br>Aoi: Yes, that's me.</br></br>Libby: Okay give me a second.</br></br>Libby opens locker number 3 and grabs a black leather jacket.</br></br>Libby: Here's your order which will be 3000 Niks.</br></br>Aoi takes out the exact amount and gives it to Libby.</br></br>Libby: Thank you, have a nice day.</br></br>Aoi walks out of the shop and looks back.</br></br>Aoi:<em> That was him, I clearly remember him. Did he recognize me?</em></br></br>The day passes by and Libby leaves the shop for the day.</br></br>Libby: I will be going now, boss.</br></br>Reu: Okay, take care, Libby.</br></br>Libby: Ahh, What am I gonna do now? I should have asked him to pay me early. What am I gonna eat for tomorrow???.</br></br>Libby:<em> Okay okay slow down I got this I can go a day or two without food, yes totally.</em></br></br>Red: Hey Libby! How are you?.</br></br>Libby: Oh hey Red! I'm fine, I just finished work.</br></br>Red: Wanna go out for lunch?</br></br>Libby:<em> I can't go, I have no money, and I can't ask him to buy me lunch. That's embarrassing.</em></br></br>Libby: Sorry, not today.</br></br>Red: Oh, okay then wanna go for a walk instead?</br></br>Libby: Okay, sure.</br></br>Libby:<em> I'm starving</em></br></br>Red notices Libby's posture and lack of energy.</br></br>Red: What's up with him? He isn't like his usual self.</br></br>Red: Hey Libby you don't look good, are you good?</br></br>Libby: yeah yeah "I'm doing great".</br></br>Red: your voice just shook.</br></br>Libby clears his throat loudly.</br></br>Libby: haha no I'm fine completely fine what makes you say that?</br></br>Red: your posture and the lack of energy and you look down.</br></br>Libby fixes his posture and opens his eyes widely.</br></br>Libby: Hehe.</br></br>Red: hmm, anyways what did you do after we said goodbye yesterday?</br></br>Libby: Just went home, took a shower, ate some cooked chicken, and went to sleep.</br></br>Libby:<em> Now I want some chicken</em></br></br>Red: Just like always right?</br></br>Libby: Yep... you, what did you do?</br></br>Red: uh, nothing. I just showered and went to sleep.</br></br>Libby: Your dad came home?</br></br>Red: No not today he's still working.</br></br>Libby: I see.</br></br>Libby: It's getting late huh?</br></br>Red: Yeah I better get home, see you tomorrow.</br></br>Libby: Okay cya.</br></br>Red ran inside the forest and followed the trail to his house.</br></br>Libby: Okay guess I'll sleep on the bench again.</br></br>Libby smells himself and grunts.</br></br>Libby: Yeah I smell now, it's okay it's okay.</br></br>A black cat comes from the shadows of the trees and approaches Libby.</br></br>Libby: Hello? Oh hello, kitty.</br></br>Libby: What are you doing here?</br></br>Libby: hungry? Mee too.</br></br>Libby: I'll start calling you Silvester, how about that?</br></br>The cat stares at Libby and leaves.</br></br>Libby: Okay see ya.</br></br>Libby: YAWNNN, time to sleep.</br></br>The sun falls and night rises, and the creatures of the dark come out of hiding, to hunt for survival, evil also lurks at night.</br></br>The scene changes to a big room.</br></br>In the room, a man is eating at his round table when suddenly the lights turn off.</br></br>Man: another blackout…</br></br>Man: This house can't run the power right, I should sell the house and buy a new one.</br></br>The person goes to the breaker box but stops when he hears a loud crash.</br></br>CRASH!!!</br></br>Man: Who's there?!.</br></br>The man quickly flips the break but it does not turn on the lights. He tries again, but nothing.</br></br>The man pulls out his gun from his pocket and points it out.</br></br>Man: I know you're there, come out!</br></br>Man: I'm gonna shoot!</br></br>The person pulls on the trigger and the gunfire reveals the shadow he shot; it was a pillow hanging from the ceiling. The pillow had a bunny painted on it with black ink.</br></br>Man:<em> What?</em></br></br>The man feels a breath from behind and quickly turns around and fires his gun but gets stabbed in the back.</br></br>Man: AAARGH!!.</br></br>The mysterious man pulls out his blade from the man's stomach and kicks him onto the ground.</br></br>The man puts his hands on his stomach and grunts in pain.</br></br>Man: You shithead! Who are you?</br></br>The man pointed his gun at the intruder but he got his hand sliced off. The man looks at his hand and starts screaming like a madman.</br></br>Man: AHHHHH!</br></br>The man can't stop breathing so heavily. His body is shaking uncontrollably fast.</br></br>Man: WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME YOU PIECE OF SHI…</br></br>Jack slices his head off with his katana.</br></br>Jack: Another long day...</br></br>Jack cleans the blood and picks up the man's gun and head off the floor and puts it in a big black bag.</br></br>Jack leaves the house in a rush. Jack arrives in an abandoned shop. He enters the shop and opens a door in the back, he walks to the middle where he meets his boss, Jack throws the bag on the floor.</br></br>Aoi: Jack The Ripper, Welcome back!</br></br>Aoi picks up the bag from the floor and gives it to another guy in the room.</br></br>Aoi: Thank you for killing off our little traitor here, here's your paycheck as promised.</br></br>Aoi tosses an envelope to jack.</br></br>Jack: you're short on cash.</br></br>Aoi: Really? How much?</br></br>Jack: 5,000.</br></br>Aoi: My bad, I got my numbers mixed up here you go.</br></br>Jack catches the rest of the money and prepares to leave.</br></br>Aoi: Before you go, I have another task for you, I want you to kill these two, Libby Hart and Red Madden.</br></br>End of chapter one.</br></br>`,

    story: `Aoi: I want you to kill these two Libby Hart and Red Madden.</br></br>Aoi gives Jack two photos, one of Libby and one of Red.</br></br>Aoi: These two escaped our attack and reported us to the police so we're now suspects.</br></br>Jack: If I kill them wouldn't that make the police start searching us?</br></br>Aoi: Don't worry, I just need you to kill those two. Their lives are shit already so we'll be doing them a "favor".</br></br>Jack: That doesn't explain how you'll get off police suspicion.</br></br>Aoi: Do you think the law gives a shit about the town?</br></br>Aoi: No! If it was the opposite we would be rotting in prison.</br></br>Aoi: Plus they probably already dropped the case. This small town is a criminal's paradise.</br></br>Jack: Hmm.</br></br>Jack: Okay, How much money are you gonna give me?</br></br>Aoi: 40k.</br></br>Jack: I'll be back in 48 hours.</br></br>Aoi: I'll be waiting.</br></br>The sun rises from the abyss and fills up the earth with its light, the sunlight shines on Libby's face and wakes him up. Libby gets up from his bench and starts doing some stretches.</br></br>Libby: YAWNNN.</br></br>while rubbing his eyes.</br></br>Libby: Day two of sleeping on a bench! If I remember there's a river nearby, I can wash up there and get ready for work.</br></br>Libby heads west and walks for a while until he finds the river. Libby washes up quickly and puts on his white button-up shirt and black sweatpants. After finishing he quickly runs to his job.</br></br>Libby: I'm here!</br></br>Reu was picking up the shop and packing his equipment.</br></br>Libby: Boss what's going on?</br></br>Reu: Libby I'm selling the shop, there have been fewer customers each day and I'm not getting enough income to pay my monthly debt. If I sell the shop I'll have enough to pay off the debt and move in with my son who lives in the city.</br></br>Libby: Oh.</br></br>Reu: Libby, I'm sorry but this is all I can pay you at the moment. The rest I will pay in favors, clothing, shoes, anything in my profession will be free for you.</br></br>Reu hands Libby 1000 Niks.</br></br>Libby: Oh ok, that's fine I hope you can sell the store.</br></br>Reu: Thanks and sorry again Libby.</br></br>Libby: It's ok, Do you know someone who is looking for employees?</br></br>Reu: No not at the moment sorry.</br></br>Libby: Oh ok thanks and goodbye boss.</br></br>Reu: Goodbye Libby.</br></br>Libby heads out the door and takes a deep breath and cries for a little. Libby rubs his eyes and keeps on walking, he looks around town in mind of finding a new job.</br></br>Libby: <em>Is no one hiring?</em></br></br>Libby goes inside a small restaurant and orders food. a girl in a black apron was taking people to a table, then she tumbled upon Libby.</br></br>Libby: Hi.</br></br>Waiter: welcome can I take your order?</br></br>Libby: Yes can I get a bowl of dark beans?</br></br>Waiter: Yes that will be 100 Niks.</br></br>Libby hands her the money and smiles.</br></br>Waiter: <em>That guy is cute.</em></br></br>Waiter: Thank you, let me take you to your seat.</br></br>Libby: Okay, thanks.</br></br>Waiter: Your food will be ready in a minute.</br></br>A minute passes by and the waiter brings Libby his food.</br></br>Libby: Thanks.</br></br>Waiter: Yeah, enjoy.</br></br>Libby eats his food and takes his time tasting it.</br></br>Libby: <em>This is very good! I wonder who made it.</em></br></br>Libby finishes his food and leaves the restaurant.</br></br>Jack was looking at Libby from a distance in the restaurant.</br></br>When Libby gets out he finds the waiter with a tall blonde man, the man looks at Libby and stares, and Libby walks away.</br></br>Mase: Hey… Libby.</br></br>Libby: ?</br></br>Mase: It's you! I'm Mase. I was a friend of your mom back then.</br></br>Libby: Ah hello.</br></br>Libby: <em>I don't know who he is.</em></br></br>Mase: You were only 5 when I first saw ya.</br></br>Libby: When I was five, hmmm.</br></br>Libby: Sorry haha I can't remember.</br></br>Mase: It's okay how's ya mom?</br></br>Libby: My mom died 7 years ago.</br></br>Mase: Oh, I'm sorry about that.</br></br>Libby: It's okay you didn't know.</br></br>Mase: Hey how is your dad doing?

It's just me and my daughter who maintain it. It would be good if I had an extra pair of hands helping me. I can pay you too if you can help me around the church.</br></br>Libby: I don't have a job right now, hmm... sure when do we start?</br></br>Mase: Is today good?</br></br>Libby: That's fine.</br></br>Red: Hey Libby.</br></br>Libby: Oh hey. Excuse me for a bit, sorry.</br></br>Mase: All good.</br></br>Libby: What's up?</br></br>Red: Nothing just saw you and wanted to say hi, I see you're busy I'll leave now, can we hang out later?</br></br>Libby: hmmm... I'll try to make some time.</br></br>Red: Okay great, cya.</br></br>Libby: cya.</br></br>Red walks down the sidewalk and runs away.</br></br>Libby: So uh back to what we were talking about.</br></br>Mase: Yeah Libby follow me and I'll take you to the church.</br></br>Libby: Okay.</br></br>Libby and Mase walk down the street and enter the rural parts of town.</br></br>Libby: <em>Phew, I was able to get a job today!</em></br></br>Mase: It isn't polite to stay quiet, introduce yourself.</br></br>Ally: Sorry I'm Ally.</br></br>Libby: Hello, I'm Libby.</br></br>Ally: Nice name.</br></br>Libby: Thanks.</br></br>It went quiet.</br></br>Libby: Soo Mase what do you teach in your church?</br></br>Mase: Um, I teach Christianity.</br></br>Libby: Cool.</br></br>Mase: Hey Libby would you want to stay in one of the rooms in my church?</br></br>Mase: I have some rooms in the church but I haven't found a use for them and maybe you would like to stay in one of them?.</br></br>Libby: <em>A room and a job! Awesome.</em></br></br>Libby: I'll gladly take the room.</br></br>Mase: Nice thank you.</br></br>Libby: Yeah.</br></br>Mase: Here we are!</br></br>The church looked old and a little weird; some parts of the walls were broken.</br></br>Libby: <em>This is the church? It doesn't look in a good condition to have people inside of it.</em></br></br>Libby: Interesting.</br></br>Mase: It looks a bit broken here and there but hey now that we have you we'll be able to fix this place up.</br></br>Mase: here come inside.</br></br>Everyone entered inside, it was better than the outside. It was tidy, clean, and calm.</br></br>Libby: Woah.</br></br>Mase: Here's a lot cleaner than the outside. It's a big place but not many people come here that's okay though.</br></br>Libby: I like it!</br></br>Mase: Thanks. Let me tell you something, this was my grandfather's house before then he gave the land to my dad, then my dad remade this place into a church and later he gave me this place after he passed away because of a disease.</br></br>Libby: Quite the story, this place has been handed down to you. That's cool.</br></br>Mase: Yeah, anyways enough chit-chat time to do what we came here to do.</br></br>Mase: Libby I'll leave the kitchen and upstairs cleaning to you.</br></br>Libby: Okay.</br></br>Mase: The cleaning tools are in the closet Ally lead Libby to the closet would you.</br></br>Ally: Yes dad.</br></br>Ally: Follow me.</br></br>Libby and everyone else cleans up the church very nicely. It took them hours but the cleaning was worth it.</br></br>Libby: Woah this place does look better.</br></br>Ally: Yeah it does.</br></br>Mase: Good job everyone! It looks great.</br></br>Libby: Indeed.</br></br>Mase: How does dinner sound?</br></br>Libby: Wonderful!</br></br>Mase: Haha. Ally, go prepare one of your famous foods.</br></br>Ally: Right away.</br></br>Ally: <em>What should I make, I want to impress that Libby guy but I don't know what he likes. He ate a bowl of black beans. Aha, I can make white rice with black beans. I hope he likes them.</em></br></br>Ally gets to cooking and prepares everything. A few minutes pass and the food is ready.</br></br>Ally: Here you go, dad and Libby.</br></br>Ally: <em>I hope he likes it.</em></br></br>Libby: <em>This day is going too well.

    story: `It has been 20 hours since jacks assassination deadline.</br></br>The same night Red was walking through the forest, calmly until he heard a bunch of leaves crumble.</br></br>Red: …</br></br>Red: <em>That was no animal</em></br></br>Red looked around and was able to spot someone in the trees, his face was covered with the shadow of the trees, he had a strong body and he was holding a large blade.</br></br>Red quickly ran to his home. As he arrived red shouted out.</br></br>Red: Open the gate!</br></br>One of the housekeepers heard red and hurried to the gate. They opened it for him and red quickly got inside.</br></br>Red: Get inside.</br></br>Housekeeper: What's the matter?</br></br>Red: Someone is following me.</br></br>Housekeeper: Oh god, should I call the police?</br></br>Red: Yes, hurry.</br></br>The housekeeper runs to the telephone and dials the police phone number.

Why are you adding that to the food?</br></br>Ally: I just thought it would fit better as it tastes plain.</br></br>Sandra: No you have to follow MY recipe!</br></br>Ally: But…</br></br>Sandra: No buts!</br></br>Ally: Yes Ms.Sandra.</br></br>Ema: Did you see her? She thought just because she is great at cooking she thinks she can change someone's recipe.</br></br>Alyn: Yeah I did.</br></br>Ally: Sigh.</br></br>Sandra: Some people don't like the food here. They're always saying it has no flavor, it tastes plain, they say.</br></br>Ema: Ms.Sandra maybe if you change the recipe a bit people will like the food?</br></br>Sandra: The recipe stays the way it is!</br></br>Ema: Sorry that is true…</br></br>Ally looks at Ema, Ema had a sad face when her opinion got rejected.</br></br>Ally: Are you okay?</br></br>Ema: Are you talking to me?!</br></br>Ema: Who are you to talk to me, you lowlife whore!</br></br>Ally: Sorry.</br></br>Ally walks away and feels sorrow.</br></br>Ally starts to work on another order. She tastes the food but still, it tastes plain. Ally looks around to try to not get caught. She puts in some spice but Ema catches her and reports her to Sandra.</br></br>Sandra: I told you to not add anything else, the recipe stays just the way it is!!</br></br>Ally: I'm sorry, it's just that I don't like it.</br></br>Sandra: I don't care if you don't like it you do as I say Ally!!</br></br>Ally: Ye…</br></br>Sandra: You know what, I can't work with you. You're fired.</br></br>Ally: Ms.Sandra I was doing excellent and I didn't question your orders, Please don't do this to me.</br></br>Sandra slaps Ally.</br></br>Sandra: Get out!</br></br>Ally tries to speak but her tears choke her. Ally grabs her stuff and leaves the restaurant.</br></br>Sandra: Get to work before I fire you too!</br></br>Sandra bumps into someone.</br></br>Sandra: Hey move it bitc-</br></br>Sandra: Boss! What are you doing here?</br></br>Aoi: Ms.Sandra I have come here for the money.</br></br>Sandra: Well I don't have the money right now.</br></br>Aoi: Hm, That's unfortunate.</br></br>Sandra: I will pay you back I promise.</br></br>Aoi: I remember that's what you said last time Sandra.</br></br>Sandra: Yes but I recently had some problems with my customers, just give me more time.</br></br>Aoi: very well </br></br>Sandra: Thank you!</br></br>Aoi and his crew walk out of the restaurant.</br></br>Thug: Are you gonna let them go like that?</br></br>Aoi: No, burn the building.</br></br>Thug: Yes boss.</br></br>The thug grabs a gallon of gasoline and pours some on the outside walls and then he sets the place on fire.</br></br>The thug quickly runs away right after starting the fire.</br></br>Sandra: Hey why did the alarm go off?</br></br>Sandra: AHHHHHH!</br></br>Sandra and everyone there quickly got out of the restaurant and waited outside. Sandra stood there crying as she watched her restaurant burn to the ground.</br></br>Aoi: That's why you never ask a favor from us if you're not gonna pay it back.</br></br>Thug: haha.</br></br>Aoi: Now we have that done, now we need to find that Reu.</br></br>Thug: Reu, that old guy?</br></br>Aoi: Yeah.</br></br>Thug: Oh okay.</br></br>Aoi: his store is around here.</br></br>Aoi walks around the block to find Reu's store, after walking to the other side of town he enters the store.</br></br>Aoi: Reu, I'm here to pick up an order.</br></br>Reu: I have your money.</br></br>Reu hands Aoi some cash and then goes behind the counter.</br></br>Aoi: You are almost done. you just need to pay a little more and you're free.</br></br>Reu: Yes.</br></br>Aoi: Thank you, I'll be back in a month.</br></br>Reu: I'll be ready.</br></br>Aoi and his gang walk out of the store.</br></br>Aoi: Now hunting time.</br></br>Thug: Hey boss.</br></br>Aoi: Yeah?</br></br>Thug: isn't that the guy we are looking for?</br></br>The thug gives Aoi a picture of Libby and compares them.</br></br>Aoi: Yes it is!</br></br>Aoi and his gang hurry up to catch up to Libby. They meet him at the store entrance and take him to a dead end.</br></br>Libby: Hey, what are you doing?!</br></br>Aoi: Hello Libby.</br></br>Aoi pushes Libby to the ground. A thug hands Aoi a pistol with a silencer.</br></br>Libby: Hey this isn't funny.</br></br>Aoi: It kinda is.</br></br>Aoi points the gun at Libby. Libby gets up and then gets punched back to the ground.</br></br>Aoi: One more mouse killed by the gray cat.</br></br>Libby:?</br></br>pew pew!</br></br>Aoi: !!!</br></br>Aoi missed!

Aoi falls to the ground, and Libby takes this chance to run away.</br></br>Libby: Ah I'm screwed, thanks to that book I read I was able to perform that kick. But that first kick was almost perfect…</br></br>Aoi gets up and follows Libby with his gun showing. Some police officers notice Aoi's gun and chase him down. Aoi shoots his gun but misses.</br></br>Aoi: Shit!</br></br>Police: Hey stand down!</br></br>Aoi: Shit Shit Shit!</br></br>Police: We got you surrounded and lower your weapon!</br></br>Aoi drops his gun and kneels.

Libby runs inside and sees Mase under a crate. Libby easily lifts the crate and helps Mase get up.</br></br>Libby: You okay?!</br></br>Mase: Yeah, just a little hurt.</br></br>Libby: you're bleeding, in your hand.</br></br>Mase: oh no.</br></br>Libby: Ahhh what should I do?</br></br>Mase: Leave me there by the tree. I just need to rest and bring the first aid kit inside the shed.</br></br>Libby: Okay.</br></br>Libby settles Mase down the tree and returns to the shed to pick up the crates.</br></br>Libby: What do you have in these?</br></br>Mase: Decorations. Hey, that last box was pretty large and it had a lot of tools inside it should have been heavy for ya.</br></br>Mase: it's like you have super strength.</br></br>Libby: uh maybe I do. It was heavy though.</br></br>After clearing the crates and treating Mase, Ally approaches Libby.</br></br>Ally: Hey can we talk?</br></br>Libby: Yea.</br></br>Ally: You broke that bat in half with your fist yesterday and you were able to pick up that box with ease. That should have been hard for ya, let me see your hand.</br></br>Ally grabs Libby's hand and sees that it's bruised.</br></br>Ally: Does it hurt when I touch it?</br></br>Libby: A little.</br></br>Ally: You seem fine, the bruises should have taken longer to heal for you to feel no major pain.</br></br>Libby: Uh, I-i work out sometimes.</br></br>Ally: No Libby this is not normal, you are not normal.</br></br>Libby:...?</br></br>Ally: Libby, are you human?</br></br>End of chapter six.`,

He has proved to be a very dangerous guy, Jack hasn't come back since we gave him the job to kill him.</br></br>Sato Youhu: Jack is dead?</br></br>Aoi: We don't know but most probably.</br></br>Sato Youhu: fuck!</br></br>Sato Youhu: I'm gonna take a stroll.</br></br>Aoi: Want me to escort you?</br></br>Sato Youhu: No, we need to replace Jack, find me someone else.</br></br>Aoi: Yes…</br></br>Aoi: <em>Replace him we simply can't his skills were inhuman.</em></br></br>Youhu walks out of the base for a walk, he walks around town for a while until he notices a girl. He suddenly felt a surge of anxiety.</br></br>Sato Youhu: <em>What's this feeling?</em></br></br>Youhu stalks the girl for a while, the girl sees him and tries to run to safety. Youhu ran to get her but suddenly got her in a corner.</br></br>Growl!</br></br>Youhu was not Youhu anymore, he was a tiger.</br></br>The girl screams for help, and Youhu quickly kills her and eats her. Several cops heard this and rushed to the scene, what they saw was a tiger running out the corner. The cops saw the corpse and decided to chase the tiger down.</br></br>Policeman: Hey did you see a tiger run by?</br></br>Sato Youhu: Yes! Over there I saw it!</br></br>Policeman: Thanks!</br></br>Youhu sits down on a bench and looks at his hands.</br></br>Sato Youhu: <em>I am a tiger!</em></br></br>Sato Youhu: <em>I killed her but I don't feel anything</em></br></br>Sato Youhu: <em>It will be easy when the time comes.</em></br></br>Sato Youhu: So that's what he meant, is he also like me?</br></br>Sato Youhu: What the hell am I?</br></br>Youhu runs back to the base. Panting.</br></br>Aoi: Boss! Are you alright?</br></br>Sato Youhu: Yeah yeah.</br></br>Aoi: Okay boss this is Clover, one of Nikolo's friends.

I took him and said come with me I will take you to a safe place.</br></br>Aoi: How did his dad die?</br></br>Sato Youhu: some of my men misfired and it ended as a stray bullet. </br></br>Aoi: Oh.</br></br>Sato Youhu: Later I saw how he was really into fighting so I gave him a strict routine to train and study fighting techniques.</br></br>Aoi: You were the one who trained him?</br></br>Sato Youhu: No, he trained himself.</br></br>Sato Youhu: He was really smart and gifted but he was lonely.</br></br>Sato Youhu: I used him as a weapon.</br></br>Aoi: He was mysterious so we didn't talk to him.</br></br>Sato Youhu: Hm.</br></br>Sato Youhu: That is not the point. I gave a child a rough life with no friends and no childhood. I made him kill, for me.

Libby finds the church and slowly opens the church door so he wouldn't wake anyone up. He walks up the stairs slowly and then goes to his room and closes the door and stands in the middle of the room.</br></br>Libby: Hah, that was wild!</br></br>Libby undresses and puts the guns and drugs in his bed.</br></br>Libby: <em>Where can I hide these?</em></br></br>Libby looks at the wood floor. Libby walks around and puts more weight into every step.</br></br>Libby: !!</br></br>Libby crouches down. He pushes the wood plank down. Libby looks around for a screwdriver or knife anything to help him peel off the floor. He looks in his drawer and finds a little screwdriver.</br></br>Libby: This will do.</br></br>Libby starts peeling off the plank and takes off one piece.</br></br>Libby: This one has no support, why didn't they cover it?</br></br>Libby looks inside and its hollow and dark.

Libby sees some small amount of white powder inside.</br></br>Libby: oh, they were doing the same thing as me…</br></br>Libby: Well I'm not consuming them, haha.</br></br>Libby shoves the guns and drugs inside the hole. He covers up everything and puts the plank back on. He looks for a rug. He goes inside the bathroom and snatches the rug from there and places it on the room floor.</br></br>Libby: This will do.</br></br>Libby cleans up and goes to his bed. He looks at his drawer and looks at his bible. He grabs it and shuffles the pages until he chooses one.</br></br>Libby: Matthew 5:9. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.</br></br>Libby: Nice, time to sleep.</br></br>He rolls up inside the blanket and goes to sleep.</br></br>Friday, October 10, 1975, 5:30 a.m</br></br>Sato Youhu: What the fuck!

    story: `Sunday, October 12, 1975, 10:17 a.m</br></br>Mase:[knocking on the door] Libby I have something for you!</br></br>Libby:[Hastily putting on some pants] Coming!</br></br>Libby opens the door.</br></br>Mase:[Handing him some clothes] Here ya go.</br></br>Libby:[holding them] Woah, thanks, Mase.</br></br>Mase: Hurry up and change, people will be coming soon.</br></br>Libby:[Closing the door] Will do.</br></br>Libby changes into the white button-up shirt and the blue pants.</br></br>Libby:[Fixing his shirt] <em>It is comfortable, but it’s kind of a weird match.</em></br></br>Libby opens his door and goes downstairs to meet with Ally and Mase. Mase is wearing some formal clothes fit for a pastor and Ally is wearing a long black dress.</br></br>Libby: Morning!</br></br>Ally: Hey!</br></br>Mase:[Closing his bible] Well we're all ready now, let’s go!</br></br>Everyone walks out of the kitchen and into the altar. Mase walks on stage and puts his bible on the stand.</br></br>Mase: Open the doors!</br></br>Libby:[Opening] Yes sir!</br></br>A lot of people come in and take a seat.</br></br>Libby:<em> That's a lot of people!</em></br></br>Ally: Welcome… Welcome!</br></br>Sato Youhu: So this is the place.</br></br>Youhu takes a seat and looks for Libby.</br></br>Libby stands in the back, he looks around then focuses his eyes on Mase.</br></br>Everyone was seated, and almost all the seats were taken.</br></br>Mase:[Putting his bible on the stand]<em>Thank you God this is a large audience</em></br></br>Mase: Welcome everyone, thank you for joining us today. I want to give a reflection for today.</br></br>Mase grabs a toy boat from his stand.</br></br>Mase: Do you know how much you're worth? There's a show called The Six Million Dollar Man, now that's a lot of money right? I would probably say 500 Niks… or 1000 for a human being. But I want to tell you that you're worth more than that, you're worth more than all the money in the world.</br></br>Libby:?</br></br>Mase:[Holding the toy boat] There was a boy who built a boat from a choice of wood. He carefully carved the wood into the shape of a boat [Shaking his wrist] Then he painted the boat blue, it looked good but it wasn't done yet something was missing, he fetched a piece of cloth from his mother’s closet and he made a sail from the cloth and put it in the boat. He wanted to see if the boat floated so he went to the river and to his surprise… it floated, he was so overjoyed. He played with his boat for hours and hours until… one day a wind took the boat farther than it had ever sailed, the boy chased the boat until it was far from his reach, the boy was so sad. One day when he was walking through town he saw his boat In the window display of a pawn shop. It was rather messed up but he was able to identify it. Blue and with gold sails, he hurried inside and said to the man, "That's my boat in your window sir, I made it" The shopkeeper said to him "I had this boat brought to me this morning you'll have to buy it from me boy" The boy emptied his pockets and got 2 small coins out. "Is this enough?" The shopkeeper laughed and said "You'll need way more of those to buy the boat, kid" and the boy replied, "I'll buy it back but please save it for me." The shopkeeper happily agreed. The boy collected all his money and worked so hard to get more money for his beloved boat. One day he had enough to buy his boat back, he ran as fast to the pawn shop and put all his coins on the counter. "I want to buy my boat back sir" the shopkeeper grabbed his boat from the back and gave the boy his boat, the boy happily went back home and fixed the boat neatly, he said, "I own you twice, I made you and I bought you".</br></br>Mase held up the toy boat. The boat looked exactly like the boat in the story—Blue, with a nice design and golden sails.</br></br>Mase:[Putting down the boat] This reflection is one of my favorites. The boy is God, God made us perfect in his way and let us be free, but we have gone our own way down the river… Far from God, today God wants to reunite with you again. The boy buying his boat back means God sending his son Yeshua to die for us, for his death allowed us to come back to God. [Opening his bible] Let's go to 1 Corinthians 6:20, there's a bible underneath each seat. </br></br>Sato Youhu:<em> I thought bibles didn't sell anymore because of the Easter war in 1895.</em></br></br>Mase:[Reading out loud] For God brought you with a high price. Now let me ask you again how much are you worth?</br></br>Sunday, October 12, 1975, 12:03 pm </br></br>Everyone was happily talking to each other on the way to the kitchen.</br></br>Ally:[Walking toward Libby] Hey Libby! That was a beautiful word, wasn't it?</br></br>Sato Youhu:!</br></br>Libby: Yes, yes it was.</br></br>Mase: Hey Libby can you go to the back to serve the meals?</br></br>Libby: Yes sir!</br></br>Youhu looked at Libby as he walked to the back.</br></br>Sato Youhu:<em> I need him to be alone.</em></br></br>Mase:[Walking toward him] Hey man there's some fried fish in the back if you want.</br></br>Sato Youhu:[Hastily] Ah, no thank you, pastor.</br></br>Mase: Hey.</br></br>Sato Youhu: Yes?</br></br>Mase: God loves you brother.</br></br>Sato Youhu: Hey pastor.</br></br>Mase:?</br></br>Sato Youhu:[Angry] You're not my brother.</br></br>Mase: …</br></br>Sato Youhu: My real brother and I ran away from a lab. My family was killed by them. It pisses me off to be called brother.</br></br>Youhu stands up and walks to Mase.</br></br>Sato Youhu: I only have one brother, okay?!</br></br>Mase: I can see the pain you have [Touching his shoulder]</br></br>Sato Youhu: Don't touch me!</br></br>Sato Youhu:<em> You You don't get me at all!</em></br></br>Sato Youhu:[Pushing his gun to Mase] I will kill you!</br></br>Mase: Can I pray for you?</br></br>Sato Youhu:<em> How is this guy so calm!</em></br></br>Mase closes his eyes and starts praying but Youhu accidentally pulled the trigger… The bullet killed Mase.</br></br>Bam!</br></br>Sato Youhu:[Scared]<em> Fuck what did i do!</em></br></br>Youhu ran out of the church. Everyone heard the gunshot and started panicking.</br></br>AHHH!</br></br>Libby: What's going on?</br></br>Man:[Getting up] Stay calm everyone! I'm a police officer!</br></br>Everyone stopped and got a little calmed.</br></br>Policeman: Everyone please evacuate from the back door.</br></br>Everyone listened and evacuated.</br></br>The officer went to the altar and saw Mase lying on the floor. He got his radio and called for backup.</br></br>Libby followed him and saw Mase on the floor.</br></br>Libby:[Running] Maseeee!!</br></br>Libby grabbed his body and hugged it.</br></br>Libby:[Crying] Mase! Mase! Mase! No!</br></br>The policeman crouches down and touches Mase's neck.</br></br>Policeman:[Checking for a pulse] Sorry but he's gone…Sigh! [Getting up] Who could have done this? Why did this man of God deserve death?</br></br>Libby touches a bullet and grabs it, he holds it in his hand.</br></br>Policeman: Hey let me see that. [Examining the bullet] This is a good clue, let's wait for the backup to get here.</br></br>Libby:[Crying] Mase?!</br></br>Ally was confused by the sudden racket and decides to look for Libby. She goes to the altar and sees Mase on the ground.</br></br>Ally:[Shocked] Daddy!</br></br>Both Ally and Libby cry on their knees.</br></br>Monday, October 13, 1975, 7 a.m</br></br>Libby and Ally watch men cover Mase's grave. Ally starts bursting into tears.</br></br>Libby looks at Ally and hugs her, comforting her. Libby looks at Mase's tombstone and stares.</br></br>Libby: Why! Why him?! Why God! Whyyy!</br></br>Ally and Libby stay under an umbrella staring at the tomb while it rains.</br></br>Ally:[Sad] Libby will we be alright?</br></br>Libby: I-i don't know, Ally.</br></br>Ally: Sorry.</br></br>Libby: It's okay </br></br>Libby:<em> Was it my fault? No of course, not they were the ones doing wrong!</em></br></br>Libby's face switched from sad to Killer.</br></br>Libby:<em> Aoi what terrible thing did you do, I will kill you! I will avenge you Mase!</em></br></br>Libby: Let's go.</br></br>Ally: Okay.</br></br>Both of them walk away.</br></br>End of chapter 13.`,
